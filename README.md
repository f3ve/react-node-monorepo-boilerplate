# React & Node Monorepo boilerplate.

This monorepo is setup with my preferred boilerplate for building NodeJS React projects.

If you prefer to use a different frontend framework you can easily [remove react](#use-a-different-frontend-framework) and install the dependencies for your preferred library.

## Getting started

**Clone this repo locally**

```bash
git clone <url> ./my-app && cd ./my-app\
```

**Remove the git history so you can start fresh**

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

**Now initialize git**

```bash
git init
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm i
```

That's it! you can now start building your projects to your hearts content. Happy coding.
